			<h1>Financially transparent</h1>
            <p>
            Money is a powerful force in our culture. You can do a lot with money, we can pull our money together
            we can do amazing things. But money has a seriously good track record of making people stupid and greedy. 
          
			</p>
			<p><h3>Transparenty equals trust</h3> we have a real time financial feed. All membership fees, donations, any income a project might generate,  all purchases, payments of any kind calculated real time, up front 100% public.
			Right now we see the project as a simple, we pool our money and make something great we can all share. I would love for this idea to spread into all projects. No shadowy area, no huge salaries.
			</p>
			<p><h3>Transparenty forces accountability</h3> by becoming a member you are putting your trust that we will be spending it on making maintaining and developing  organic food forests, we expect and encource people to closely watch costs and expenses because you might have a 
			better idea, a cheaper source, and we can all do better together.
